Examples
==========================================================
Some example analyses based on ngEHTforecast illustrating its capabilities and
how to make use of them are contained in the **examples** folder.  If you generate
an analysis, we encourage you to upload it with a short description of what it
does in the docstring for other ngEHTforecast users!  Please ensure that your
analysis is behind the standard __name__ check, i.e.,

::
   
   """
   Short description of your analysis that will appear in documentation.
   """
   
   [Top level import statements]
   
   if __name__ == "__main__" :
       [The bulk of your analysis code, including any outputs and
       anything that takes more than a few seconds to run.]

All Python scripts in **examples** conforming to the above will appear in the
documentation the next time it is made!
